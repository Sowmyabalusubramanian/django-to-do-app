# django-to-do-app
A Django Todo App is a web application built using the Django web framework that allows users to create, manage, and track their to-do lists or tasks. It is a simple example of a web application that showcases how to use Django to create a functional application with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
Typically, a Django Todo App would have a user authentication system that allows users to register and login to the application. Once logged in, users can create new tasks, mark tasks as complete or incomplete, edit or delete existing tasks, and view their list of tasks.
The Django Todo App can be extended and customized in many ways, such as adding due dates for tasks, assigning tasks to different users, setting task priorities, and more.
